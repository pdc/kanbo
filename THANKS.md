This project includes software donated to the public good by people
around the world. There are too many to list here; instead please
follow the links below to  find out more about them.

I used the following packages:

* [Django](http://djangoproject.org/) – web framework
* [South](http://south.aeracode.org/) – migration add-on for Django
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) – JavaScript framework
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) – sortable lists with drag & drop
* [Ajaxload.info](http://ajaxload.info/) – the spinner shown during Ajax loads

My code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

The demo site <http://kanbo.me.uk/> runs on the following platform:

* [Ubuntu GNU/Linix](http://www.ubuntu.com/business/server/overview)
* [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) – web server
* [flup](http://trac.saddi.com/flup) – glue between nginx and Django

The colour scheme is based on [Aztec Nation on the Color Schemer Gallery][1].
