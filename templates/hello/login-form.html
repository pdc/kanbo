            <p>
                To save you and us time and effort, Kanbo is set up to delegate user authentication to better-known, OAuth-supporting
                web sites like Twitter and GitHub.

                <li class="log-in-with-{{ backend }}">
                    <a href="{% url socialauth_begin backend=backend %}">Log in with {{ backend|title }}</a>
                </li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first time you log in, your provider will ask you to confirm
                you are content that Kanbo knows you are logged in.
                Thereafter logging in should be a one-click process.

            <h2>About OAuth</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="http://hueniverse.com/oauth/guide/intro/">OAuth (short for open authentication)</a>
                is a system for allowing one web site (Kanbo in this case) to
                access information about you on another (such as Twitter)
                <em>without</em> handing over your password.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use Twitter authentication purely for identification
                and to get a display name and user picture. Kanbo will not
                (for example)
                create tweets on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
                With some other authentication providers, such as GitHub,
                the future plan is to additionally use
                your connection to allow you to create task boards
                based on your public repos.
