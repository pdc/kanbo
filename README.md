KANBO
=====

Every fool is writing their own kanban, Lean, Scrum, etc. story-grid board. Here’s mine.

Status
------

To early to be sure of anything

Aims
----

- Include only what is strictly needed to make the board.
- Extract maximum flexibility from what is included.
- Don’t let stories that are not stories swamp the board.
- Easy to slice by assignee, by project, etc.

Concepts
--------

Very, very rough

- Stories: Changes to the user-visible behaviour of the system.
- Wants: What the goal donor has said they want done, but not yet in a state that it can be committed to and therefore added to the project backlog.
- Achievements: Stories that have completed their life-cycle.

- Bin (State?): Show where in its life-cycle a story is. Might include project backlog, sprint backlog, in progress, testing, accepted, done, or whatever.
- Tag: Ways of classifying stories. Projects, sprints, etc., might all have tags.
- Bag: A collection of tags. There might be a bag of project tags.
- Bag rules: Says whether a story can have one or many tags from that bag.

Tghe board would be laid out with bins as columns and tags of some bag defining the rows.
